## Original Visualization Critique

The original data table from NOAA contains detailed hurricane landfall records but suffers from several visualization limitations.

**Key Issues:** - Poor pattern recognition in 200+ rows of data - No visual encoding for rapid insight generation - Difficult to compare across time, space, or intensity - Cognitive overload from dense tabular format

## Redesign 1: Temporal Trends

**Improvements:** - Time series reveals long-term patterns - LOESS smoothing shows underlying trends - Clear visualization of data collection periods

**Insights:** - High year-to-year variability in landfall frequency - No obvious long-term increasing trend - Clear gap in 1971-1982 data collection

## Redesign 2: Spatial Distribution

![Spatial Analysis](redesign2_spatial.png)

**Improvements:** - Geographic mapping of landfall locations - Dual encoding (size = wind speed, color = category) - Regional context with map background

**Insights:** - Caribbean islands are hurricane hotspots - Major storms concentrate in western Caribbean - Geographic patterns in storm intensity

## Redesign 3: Country Impact

**Improvements:** - Triple encoding (position + color + size) - Ranked country comparison - Multidimensional risk assessment

**Insights:** - Mexico experiences most frequent landfalls - Small islands face disproportionate impact - Variation in storm severity by country

## Redesign 4: Intensity Relationships

**Improvements:** - Pressure-wind relationship visualization - Marginal distributions for context - Statistical trend analysis

**Insights:** - Strong inverse pressure-wind correlation - Clear separation between intensity categories - Meteorological consistency in data
